Update README.md with project documentation links

This commit updates the README.md file to include links to various project
documentation resources. The documentation includes:

1. Project Wiki: https://github.com/example/project/wiki
2. API Documentation: https://api.example.com/docs
3. User Guide: https://docs.example.com/user-guide and Developer Documentation: https://docs.example.com/developer-guide

Each link provides access to specific documentation sections relevant to
different stakeholders involved in the project. This update ensures that
stakeholders can easily access the necessary documentation directly from the
project's README file.
